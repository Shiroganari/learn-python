Eagles - Hotel California

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
and I was thinking to my self
this could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
there were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say:


Welcome to the Hotel California
such a lovely place, such a lovely place
such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
any time of year, any time of year
you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany twisted
she got the Mersedes - benz
she got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
sweet summer sweat
some dance to remember
some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
please bring me my wine
he said: "We haven't had that spirit here
since nineteen sixty nine"
And still those voices are calling
from far away
wake you up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say:

Welcome to the Hotel California
such a lovely place
such a lovely place
such a lovely face

They're living up at the Hotel California
what a nice surprise
what a nice surprise
bring you're alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
the pink champagne on ice and she said:
We are all just prisoners here
of our own device
And in the masters chambers
they gathered for the feast
they stabbed it with their steely knives
but they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember. I was
running for the door
I had to find the passage back
to the place I was before
Relax, said the nightman
we are programmed to receive
you can check out any time you like
but you can never leave
